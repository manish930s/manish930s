# 👋 i'm manish.

I build things that think for themselves. Currently, I'm obsessed with **autonomous agents**—not just chatbots, but systems that can actually *do* stuff without hand-holding. 

I'm an **Agentic AI Engineer** by title, but a problem-solver by nature. I spend my days (and late nights) figuring out how to make LLMs more reliable, faster, and more "active" in the real world.

---

### 🧠 stuff i'm into right now
- **The "Action" in Perception-Action Loops**: Moving past RAG into actual tool execution.
- **Multi-Agent Messiness**: Using LangGraph and CrewAI to orchestrate agents that don't just loop into infinity.
- **VLM & Vision**: Teaching agents to see and understand UI/Environments.
- **Low-Latency AI**: Because nobody likes waiting for a slow model.

---

### 🛠️ tools of the trade
I don't just "know" these; I've broken (and fixed) most of them:

- **The Brains**: LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, LangChain.
- **The Models**: Claude 3.5 (my favorite), GPT-4o, Llama 3.
- **The Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Pinecone, AWS/GCP.
- **The Glue**: Python, FastAPI, SQL, Linux Bash.

### � recent builds

#### [Autonomous RAG Orchestrator](https://github.com/manish930s/ChatBot-RAG-)
> Most RAG systems are just fancy search engines. I built this one to be dynamic—using **LangGraph** so the agent can self-correct when its first search fails. It doesn't just give up.

#### [StudyCopilot](https://manish2111.pythonanywhere.com/)
> A personal project to solve my own problem: staying organized. It uses **Gemini 2.0 Flash** to sync with my calendar and quiz me on my actual notes (not generic AI garbage).
